1. We have to manually trigger builds in Xcode, if you need to do that to verify a change please ask me to do it
2. We have to manually add new directories and files into the project scope in Xcode. If you need me to do that please ask me to do it
3. When making a sequence of unrelated changes, please pause and ask me to kick of a build so we can verify the change / fix worked before moving on
4. Our project is build in Swift and SwiftUI
5. Use modern Swift best practices (concurrency, async/await, property wrappers, etc.)
6. Use OSLog for structured logging
7. If we are refactoring or removing code, remove all comments, deprecated code, logic, etc. so that we can maintain a clean codebase
8. When editing major services or utilities, be sure to check the corresponding tests to ensure they are still valid
9. If it would be helpful to have me do something outside of what you can see to help you debug, please let me know. I am eager to help.
10. For memory management, always use weak references in closures, prefer block-based notification APIs, avoid .assign(to:on:self), and ensure proper cleanup in deinit to prevent retain cycles.
11. We are using DocC for documentation, so when making changes to the code be sure to also update the relevant documentation
