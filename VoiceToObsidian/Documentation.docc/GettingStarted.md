# Getting Started with Voice to Obsidian

Learn how to use Voice to Obsidian to transform your voice recordings into well-formatted Obsidian notes.

## Overview

Voice to Obsidian is designed to streamline the process of creating notes in your Obsidian vault using voice input. This guide will help you get started with the app's core features.

## Recording Voice Notes

To record a new voice note:

1. Tap the record button on the home screen
2. Speak clearly into your device's microphone
3. Tap the stop button when you're finished recording

The app will automatically handle background recording if you switch to another app or lock your device.

## Transcription Process

After recording, the app will:

1. Immediately add your recording to the notes list with a "Processing" status
2. Transcribe your voice recording using Apple's Speech Recognition
3. Process the transcript using Claude AI to clean up filler words, incorporate your custom words, and improve formatting
4. Generate a title for your note based on the content
5. Update the note's status to "Complete" when processing finishes

You'll see real-time status indicators in the notes list showing which notes are still being processed. This allows you to continue using the app while transcription and AI processing happen in the background.

## Saving to Obsidian

To save your note to Obsidian:

1. Review the transcribed and cleaned note
2. Make any necessary edits
3. Tap "Save to Obsidian" to export the note to your configured Obsidian vault

## Configuring Your Obsidian Vault

Before using the app, you'll need to:

1. Go to Settings
2. Tap "Select Obsidian Vault"
3. Choose the directory where your Obsidian vault is located

The app will create a security-scoped bookmark to maintain access to this directory across app launches.

## Using Custom Words

To improve transcription accuracy for specialized terminology, names, or technical terms:

1. Go to Settings
2. Tap "Custom Words"
3. Add words or phrases that you commonly use

These custom words will be included as context when Claude processes your transcripts, helping it correctly recognize and format specialized terminology in your voice notes.
