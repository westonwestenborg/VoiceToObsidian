    /// In a production test suite, we would implement:
    /// - Dependency injection to inject mock audio session and recorder objects
    /// - Tests for the startRecordingAsync method with various permission scenarios
    /// - Tests for the stopRecordingAsync method with different recording states
    /// - Tests for handling audio interruptions and app state changes
    /// - Tests for background task management
    ///
    /// These more comprehensive tests would provide better coverage of the RecordingManager's
    /// functionality and edge cases.
